# Alex's Windows Optimizer Project
## What is it?

> This project was made by me due to the fact that I am on windows and every windows update usually resets a lot of my manually applied settings,
> which can be an annoyance for someone like myself who enjoys gaming and utilising my system without the expenditure of additional resources to
> unnecessary windows telemetry, tracking and resource services. The programme itself contains all the settings I found essential to the improvement
> of a low-end, mid-end and potentially high-end computer system.
